   <h1>About Batman</h1>
    
   <p>Batman is a dark creature of the night who has made it his mission to rid his home city of Gotham of crime.
      His real name is Bruce Wayne, son to Thomas and Martha Wayne who are among the richest families in Gotham.
      One night after coming from a theater, both Thomas and Martha were gunned down infront of Bruce by a mugger.
      Bruce made a promise to them then that he would rid Gotham of all crime.
      He sought out means of learning the necessary skills to start his war against crime and travelled the world to find teachers.
      He came back to Gotham and became Batman and fights crime alongside his buttler Alfred Pennyworth.</p>
